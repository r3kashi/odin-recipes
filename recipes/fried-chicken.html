          I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best
          crispy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have
          heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking
          method!

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Chicken</strong>
              <p>
                Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four
                pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the
                grocery store.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Buttermilk</strong>
              <p>
                Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too
                tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flour</strong>
              <p>
                All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something
                to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Seasonings</strong>
              <p>
                This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps
                with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and
                seasonings to taste.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Oil</strong>
              <p>
                Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a
                high smoke point.
              </p>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Make the Breading</p>
              <p>
                Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag.
                Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Dredge the Chicken</p>
              <p>
                Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on
                both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place
                the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and
                shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a baking
                sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like
                consistency.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Fry the Chicken</p>
              <p>
                Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the
                chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet,
                and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat
                to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper
                towels.
